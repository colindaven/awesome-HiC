> Awesome collections of HiC-seq analysing softwares

The eukaryotic genome have hierarchical three_dimensional conformation, where physical contacts between chromatin have been proved to govern the regulation of gene expression. High_resolution chromosome conformation capture sequencing (HiC-seq) has been one of the most important methods to investigate the 3D genome since its first publication in 2009\. Since then, numerous of softwares and packages have been developed to facilitate the analysis of HiC-seq data.
